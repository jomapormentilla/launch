# Launch
Phase Four Project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp Program. Launch is a project management tool that allows users to:
- create new Projects
- build a team
- create & assign tasks to team members
- set deadlines for tasks
- monitor progress via a dashboard overview
- communicate with other users via a built-in chat system
- browse projects made by other users

Once all tasks have been completed, then all that's left to do is to LAUNCH IT! Happy Collaborating =)

## Requirements
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

## Installation
Clone this repository into your developer environment. Change directory so that you are in the '/backend' directory, then install the required Ruby Gems using the following command:
```ruby
bundle install
```
Run the migration files to build the database:
```ruby
rails db:migrate
```
Optional: If you would like to populate the database with randomly generated information, you can run the seed file:
```ruby
rails db:seed
```

## Usage
This application uses Ruby on Rails to host a local API. Navigate to the '/backend' directory, then run the following command:
```ruby
rails s
```
With the server running, navigate to the '/frontend' directory and open 'index.html' in your favorite web browser (Google Chrom recommended).

Sign up for an account on the Sign Up page, and get ready to launch a new project!
